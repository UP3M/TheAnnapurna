			<h2 class="max-w-md text-4xl font-bold text-center md:text-left">Our Story</h2>
			<p class="max-w-sm text-justify text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-justify">
				THE ANNAPURNA BALIEXPO Company was founded in 2020, and established in 2022 legally, also we
				have accomplished so much over the years. To create a prospective economy from small
				business product become known in the world which has always been our goal. Before, In 2019
				our CEO was inspired to start this company by the crisis of Covid-19. At that time, all the
				tourism sector was stopped because of the virus outbreak, and almost all Balinese working in
				the tourism sector at that time had experienced layoffs. Including the heads of households
				who have become unemployed due to deteriorating economic conditions.
			</p>
			<p class="max-w-sm text-justify text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-justify">
				So back then, housewives and youth group gathered to form a small household business group
				to make a processed food product that could be consumed so that the product could be sold on
				the market. However, in terms of penetrating into a wider market, these micro, small and
				medium business women associations do not have insight regarding the quality of products,
				business licensing and the knowledge of packaging for these products into goods that can be
				of interest to potential consumers.
			</p>
			<p class="max-w-sm text-justify text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-justify">
				Therefore, the CEO and team decided to help and foster these Micro, Small, Medium
				Enterprises (MSMEs) in fulfilling product standardization so that quality, hygiene, health
				are guaranteed and in accordance with the nutritional adequacy rate for each of our fostered
				MSME products. So, since then, our CEO has invited all MSMEs to encourage Indonesian women
				to develop their products so that they comply with local and international standards.
			</p>
			<p class="max-w-sm text-justify text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-justify">
				Since then, in 2022 The Annapurna Baliexpo legally established and has become one of the
				centers for various products fostered by local MSMEs. Of course, this initiative not only
				helps the economy of their families individually but also helps the government and the world
				run a good business wheel and economic rotation step by step. And the most important thing
				is, this activity can reduce the unemployment rate in Indonesia after the spread of the
				Covid19 virus outbreak. At that time, we faced the most difficult times and various
				challenges arose, the first of which was the limited capital in MSMEs and our CEO's finances
				at that time. Apart from that, one of the products from the MSME group at that time had not
				found the right standard, so we used various methods and failed, but in the end, thanks to
				the persistence and hard work of the MSME group and our team, a formula was created in all
				of our products.
			</p>
			<p class="max-w-sm text-justify text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-justify">
				At The Annapurna Baliexpo Company, we encourage our community in woman, youth community and
				local people empowering and also absorb the unemployment people to be more productive, to
				always provide the best service for creating quality products wholeheartedly, so that
				potential customers can feel the sincere touch of the fingers of the women who are warriors
				for their families who produce their products for the worldwide market.
